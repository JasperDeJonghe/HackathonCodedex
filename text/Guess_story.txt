Ho Ho Ho!

Dear [Your Name],

Greetings from the festive wonderland of the North Pole! I hope this letter finds you bubbling with
excitement as the holiday season approaches.

As you may know, my elves and I are working tirelessly to prepare gifts for all the good boys and girls
around the world. The workshop is buzzing with cheerful elves, busy wrapping and packing presents to make
this Christmas extra special.

Now, here's a little secret: this year, we've added a sprinkle of magic to the gift-giving process,
and we need your help to unlock it! We've hidden some special numbers that hold the key to spreading joy
far and wide. These magical numbers are like the secret code to make every child's dream come true.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guess these magical numbers correctly.
It's a bit like a magical game that will unlock the true spirit of Christmas.
The more correct guesses you make, the more presents we can deliver to the children who have been good all year long.

But don't worry, my dear friend, I believe in you and your magical abilities!
I know you have the power to make this holiday season the most enchanting one yet.

See you tomorrow to complete it!

Sending you warm wishes and festive cheer,

Santa Claus
